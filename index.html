				<p class="project-text">This panel is one in several steps I am taking in order to outreach to the several cultural communities at the University of California, San Diego. Using my background in #marketing and #careerdevelopment I feel that its essential for peer and peer interaction in order to facilitate peer to peer growth. My background in #publicspeaking enabled me to be MC at this panel therefore better facilitating a healthy interactive conversation between four respected professors/faculty and students of all educational and ethnic backgrounds. The format consisted of preprepared questions and also a question and answer portion where students that attended were able to voice their own personal concerns about their futures. Holding such events for the purpose of #motivating and encouraging the future professionals of this world is one of my passions. </p>
